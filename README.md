KNOWN BUGS
================
All recipes using a Air Shard a currently bugged, i think this is a bug in thaumcraft 4 itself, they should just work and are coded the same as other blocks using shards which do work.
This means you cannot craft, Light Shard (Light Block because you cannot craft Light Shard), Air Block.
This all will not be removed from the mod because i am sure this will be fixed.
